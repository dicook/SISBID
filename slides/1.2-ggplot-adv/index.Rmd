# Example 2: Platypus in Australia

Where can you find the strange platypus in Australia?

If you are good at recognising the shape of Australia, you might realise that the sightings are all along the east coast and Tasmania. There is a strange location, that looks like someone saw one in Antarctica! We might need to filter this observation out later, because its extremely unlikely to have been found that far south.

We can make the data look a bit more like it is collected in Australia by making a map projection, using `coord_map`.

---

.pull-left[

```{r making a map projection, echo=TRUE, fig.height=10, out.width="100%"}
ggplot(data=platydata) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=longitude, y=latitude), 
             alpha=0.1) +
  coord_map()
```
]
.pull-right[
The locations would be even more recognisable if we added a real map underneath. One way this can be done is to use a google map. The `ggmap` package has an interface to extracting google maps. Install it and then grab a map of Australia with this code.
]
---

```{r you need a developer API to run this code, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(ggmap)
oz_bbox <- c(112.9, # min long
              -45, # min lat
              159, # max long
              -10) # max lat
oz_map <- get_map(location = oz_bbox, source = "osm") 
save(oz, file="data/oz.rda")
```

```{r load the saved map data, echo=TRUE}
load(here::here("data/oz.rda"))
ggmap(oz) + 
  geom_point(data=platydata, 
             aes(x=longitude, y=latitude), 
              alpha=0.1, colour="orange")
```

---

```{r leaflet map, echo=TRUE}
library(leaflet)
platydata %>%
  filter(!is.na(latitude), !is.na(longitude), !(eventDate=="")) %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    radius=1, opacity = 0.5, color = "orange", label = ~eventDate,
    lat = ~latitude, lng = ~longitude) 
```

---

# Temporal trend

The date of the sighting is another variable in the data set. Let's make a plot of the sightings over time. The variable is called `eventDate`. It is considered to be a `character` variable by R, so the first step is to get R to recognise that it is a date time object.

```{r create a date variable, echo=TRUE}
library(lubridate)
platydata <- platydata %>% 
  mutate(eventDate = ymd_hms(eventDate))
```

---

then we can simply plot occurrence over time.

```{r show sightings over time, echo=TRUE, out.width="60%"}
ggplot(data=platydata) +
  geom_point(aes(x=eventDate, y=1))
```


There are some records dating back before 1800. There were only records from 1770! And these first records are in the database!


---

There are a LOT more sightings in more recent years than in the 18th and 19th century, but this database has an amazing history!

```{r show jittered sightings over time, echo=TRUE, out.width="60%"}
ggplot(data=platydata) +
  geom_jitter(aes(x=eventDate, y=1))
```


---

Let's focus on records since 1900, and count the number for each year.

```{r focus on records since 1900 and count the number for each year, echo=TRUE, out.width="60%"}
platydata1900 <- platydata %>% filter(year>1900) %>%
  count(year) 
ggplot(data=platydata1900) +
  geom_point(aes(x=year, y=n))
```

```{r solution code for filtering on location and time, eval=FALSE}
# Check odd cases
platydata %>% filter(latitude < (-50)) 
# These just have the lat/long wrong
platydata %>% filter(eventDate < ymd("1850-01-01")) 
```

---

Add a trend line.

```{r add a trend line, echo=TRUE, out.width="60%"}
ggplot(data=platydata1900, aes(x=year, y=n)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se=F)
```

---
Make it interactive so that we can investigate some observations.

```{r make it interactive to investigate some observations, echo=TRUE}
library(plotly)
ggplotly()

Make sure you can make all the plots shown in this session, and then tackle the next set of tasks. 

`r countdown::countdown(10)`

# Your turn

Change the dotplot into a density plot, to focus on the locations of frequent sightings.

Do you learn anything different than from the scatterplot?

```{r solution code to density plot on map, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ggmap(oz) + 
  geom_density2d(data=platydata, aes(x=longitude, y=latitude), 
              colour="orange") 
```

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
Not a lot different. It shows perhaps high density regions around Melbourne, Brisbane and south of Sydney. These match high population sites, though, and maybe reiterates the sampling being convenience sampling. We miss the smaller areas of sightings, like northern Queensland.
```

# Your turn

Platypus are mostly found on the east coast of the country, but there is a population close to Adelaide in south Australia. Why is this? (You might need to do some sleuthing with a web search engine to answer this.)

# Your turn

*Discussion question:* Was there a population explosion in 1980 and 2004? Is the population of platypus increasing since 1900, and decreasing in the last decade?

- Subset the data to 1950-2020
- Create a new variable for decade
- Make a map separately for each decade - the `facet_wrap` function can help here.

```{r solution code for exploring population trend, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
platydata_50_10 <- platydata %>% filter(year>1949, year<2020) %>%
  mutate(decade = cut(year, breaks=seq(1950, 2020, 10),
   include.lowest=TRUE, 
   labels=c("50-59", "60-69", "70-79", "80-89", "90-99", "00-09", "10-19")))
ggmap(oz) + geom_point(data=platydata_50_10, mapping=aes(x=longitude, y=latitude), colour="orange", alpha=0.1) +
  facet_wrap(~decade)
```

# Your turn

- Focusing again on TB, choose a different country to examine, for example, Australia. 
- Create a similar sequence of plots for your chosen country's data, and feel free to experiment with new types.
- Write a data story describing what you have learned about TB in your chosen country based on a selection of your favorite plots, by putting the code and explanations into an Rmarkdown document, and compile to html.
- Feel free to share with your instructors.
