# Choices of packages for interactive graphics

- `crosstalk`: that's what shiny is based on - we will look into shiny later
- `plotly`: has come a long way in the last years, started as part of Carson Sievert's PhD thesis research. The beauty is that it builds directly onto ggplot2
- `leaflet`: (RStudio) allows to make interactive maps. Has been picking up users and has developed a stable user base.
- `ggvis`: both static and interactive graphics, work on it has stalled ... (Wickham)
- `animint2`: interactive, linked graphics with ggplot2 syntax (Toby Hocking)
-  `rCharts`, `rbokeh`, `gridSVG`, `epivizr`, `cranvas`

# plotly

The `plotly` package in R builds on the `ggplot2` package, adding interactive elements to these plots. It translates plots to javascript.


```r
library(plotly)
plot_ly(data = economics, x = ~date, y = ~unemploy / pop)
```

# Modifying plotly 

`plotly` uses elements of `crosstalk` to provide additional interactivity, such as linked highlighting



```r
sd &lt;- highlight_key(txhousing, ~year)

p &lt;- ggplot(sd, aes(month, median)) +
   geom_line(aes(group = year)) + 
   geom_smooth(data = txhousing, method = "gam") + 
   facet_wrap(~ city)

gg &lt;- ggplotly(p, height = 600, width = 1000) %&gt;%
   layout(title = "Click on a line to highlight a year")

highlight(gg)
```

# Your turn
 
- get the  code from the previous plot to run in your RStudio session
- the function `highlight` allows to make modifications in how highlighted values are presented in plotly. Read through the parameter details in `?highlight`. 
- the parameter `dynamic` is set to `FALSE` by default. Turn it to `TRUE`. What is the effect?

# Animations

- `gganimate` (Lin-Pederson) allows to make and save animations
- Animations are different from interactive graphics in that the viewer does not have any control
- useful for different important stages of a visualization (e.g. time) and to keep track of how different visualizations are related 
--

- can also be used in talks 

---
# An example animation

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.gif" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Countries are colored manually by `country_colors` (hue shows continent, saturation is individual country)

---
# How does `gganimate` work?


#### Start with a ggplot2 specification 
--

#### Add layers with graphical primitives (geoms)

--

#### Add formatting specifications

--

#### Add animation specifications

---
# A simple example

- thanks to Mitch O'Hara Wild for the [example](https://github.com/numbats/gganimate-workshop)

#### 1. Start by passing the data to ggplot

.left-code[

```r
*ggplot(economics)
```
]
.right-plot[
&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/output1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---
# A simple example

- thanks to Mitch O'Hara Wild for the [example](https://github.com/numbats/gganimate-workshop)

#### 2. add the mapping

.left-code[

```r
ggplot(economics) +
* aes(date, unemploy)
```
]
.right-plot[
&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/output2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]


---
# A simple example

- thanks to Mitch O'Hara Wild for the [example](https://github.com/numbats/gganimate-workshop)

#### 3.add a graphical primitive, let's do a line 

.left-code[

```r
ggplot(economics) +
  aes(date, unemploy) +
* geom_line()
```
]
.right-plot[
&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/output3-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---
# A simple example

- thanks to Mitch O'Hara Wild for the [example](https://github.com/numbats/gganimate-workshop)

#### 4. Just one extra line turns this into an animation!

.left-code[

```r
ggplot(economics) +
  aes(date, unemploy) +
  geom_line() +
* transition_reveal(date)
```
]
.right-plot[
&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/output5-anim-1.gif" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---
## A not-so-simple example, the datasaurus dozen
Again, we first pass in the dataset to ggplot

.left-code[

```r
*ggplot(datasaurus_dozen)
```
]
.right-plot[
&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/output5-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]
---
## A not-so-simple example, the datasaurus dozen
For each dataset we have x and y values, in addition we can map dataset to color

.left-code[

```r
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen) +
* aes(x, y, color=dataset)
```
]
.right-plot[
&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/output6-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]
---
## A not-so-simple example, the datasaurus dozen
Trying a simple scatter plot first, but there is too much information
.left-code[

```r
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen) +
  aes(x, y, color=dataset) +
* geom_point()
```
]
.right-plot[
&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/output7-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]
---
## A not-so-simple example, the datasaurus dozen

We can use facets to split up by dataset, revealing the different distributions
.left-code[

```r
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen) +
  aes(x, y, color=dataset) +
  geom_point() +
* facet_wrap(~dataset)
```
]
.right-plot[
&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/output8-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]
---
## A not-so-simple example, the datasaurus dozen
We can just as easily turn it into an animation, transitioning between dataset states! 

.left-code[

```r
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen) +
  aes(x, y) +
  geom_point() +
* transition_states(dataset, 3, 1) +
* labs(title = "Dataset: {closest_state}")

```
]
.right-plot[
&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/output9-1.gif" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

# Your turn

The `datasaurus_dozen` data set is part of the R package `datasauRus`. 

- Load the gganimate package and get the animation from the previous page to run in your R session (might take a moment)
- The function `transition_states` drives the animation. It has values 1 and 3. What do these values mean? 
Read up on their meaning and change them.

# Controlling an animation

We control plot movement with (a grammar of animation):


#### Transitions: `transition_*()` define how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.

--

#### Views: `view_*()` defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.

--

#### Shadows: `shadow_*()` defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.

--

#### Entrances/Exits: `enter_*()` and `exit_*()` define how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.

--

#### Easing: `ease_aes()` defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.

# Your Turn

The gapminder example from the beginning has the static part shown below

Add animation parts! adding `transition_time(year)` results in the visualisation from the start. 

What other animation are helpful? What views do you want to set? Maybe a shadow looks interesting?


```r
library(gapminder)

ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, colour = country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors, guide=FALSE) +
  scale_size("Population size", range = c(2, 12), breaks=c(1*10^8, 2*10^8, 5*10^8, 10^9, 2*20^9)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~continent) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
