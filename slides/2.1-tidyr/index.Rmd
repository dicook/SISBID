# Using `tidyr`, `dplyr`

- Writing readable code using **pipes**
- What is **tidy data**? Why do you want tidy data? Getting your data into tidy form using tidyr.
- Reading different **data formats**
- String operations, working with **text**

---
# The pipe operator `%>%`

- `x %>% f(y)` is the same as `f(x, y)`
- read as `then` 
- part of `dplyr` package
- pipes allow the code to be *read* like a sequence of operations

Example:

```{r read TB incidence data and check}
tb <- read_csv(here::here("data/TB_notifications_2019-07-01.csv"))
tb %>%                                  # first we get the tb data
  filter(year == 2016) %>%              # then we focus on just the year 2016
  group_by(country) %>%                 # then we group by country
  summarize(
    cases = sum(c_newinc, na.rm=TRUE)   # to create a summary of all new cases
    ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(cases))                  # then we sort countries to show highest number new cases first
```

# What is **tidy data**? 

- What do we expect tidy data to look like?
- Couple of exercises to look closer at what we find in practice

# Your turn 1

What are the variables?

```{r example 1 What are the variables, echo=FALSE}
grad <- read_csv(here::here("data/graduate-programs.csv"))
head(grad[c(2,3,4,6)])
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
in the columns, subject, Inst, AvNumPubs, ...
```

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn 2

What's in the column names of this data? What are the experimental units? What are the measured variables?

```{r example 2 whats in the column names, echo=FALSE}
genes <- read_csv(here::here("data/genes.csv"))
head(genes)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
the experimental design is coded into the variable names, genotype:WI/WM, time:6/12, rep:1/2/4
```

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn 3

What are the variables? What are the records?

```{r example 3 what are the variables and records, echo=FALSE}
melbtemp <- read.fwf(here::here("data/ASN00086282.dly"), 
   c(11, 4, 2, 4, rep(c(5, 1, 1, 1), 31)), fill=T)
head(melbtemp[,c(1,2,3,4,seq(5,100,4))])
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
variables are TMAX, TMIN, PRCP, year, month, day, stationid. Each row contains the values for one month!
```

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn 4

What are the variables? What are the experimental units?

```{r example 4 what are the variables and experimental units, echo=FALSE}
tb <- read_csv(here::here("data/tb.csv"))
tail(tb)
#colnames(tb)
```

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn 5 

What are the variables? What are the observations?

```{r example 4 what are the variables and observations, echo=FALSE}
pew <- read.delim(
  file = "http://stat405.had.co.nz/data/pew.txt",
  header = TRUE,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
  check.names = F
)
pew[1:5, 1:5]
```

# Your turn 6

10 week sensory experiment, 12 individuals assessed taste of french fries on several scales (how potato-y, buttery, grassy, rancid, paint-y do they taste?), fried in one of 3 different oils, replicated twice. First few rows:

```{r example 6 what are the factors measurements and experimental units, echo = FALSE}
load(here::here("data/french_fries.rda"))
head(french_fries, 4)
```

What is the experimental unit? What are the factors of the experiment? What was measured? What do you want to know?

# Messy data patterns

There are various features of messy data that one can observe in practice. Here are some of the more commonly observed patterns:

- Column headers are values, not variable names
- Variables are stored in both rows and columns, contingency table format
- One type of experimental unit stored in multiple tables
- Dates in many different formats

---
# What is tidy data?

- Each observation forms a row
- Each variable forms a column
- Data is contained in a single table
- Long form makes it easier to reshape in many different ways
- Wider forms are common for analysis

# Tidy verbs

- `pivot_longer`: specify the **keys** (identifiers) and the **values** (measures) to make long form (used to be called melting or gathering)
- `pivot_wider`: variables in columns (used to be called casting or spreading)
- `separate`/`unite`: split and combine columns
- `nest`/`unnest`: working with list variables

---
# Gather the data 
  
`pivot_longer(data, cols, names_to = "name", values_to = "value", ...)`

`data %>% pivot_longer(cols, names_to = "name", values_to = "value", ...)`

- `pivot_longer` turns a wide format into a long format
- two new variables are introduced (in key-value format): **name** and **value**: multiple columns (specified in `...`) are collapsed; their names go into variable `name`, their values go into variable `value`.

```{r setup a simple example, echo = FALSE}
dframe <- data.frame(id = 1:2, trtA=c(2.5,4.6), trtB = c(45, 35))
```

```{r gather the example data into long form}
dframe
dframe %>% pivot_longer(trtA:trtB, "treatment", "outcome")
```

---
# TB notifications
  
new notifications of TB have the form `new_sp_sexage`:
  
```{r read in and process the TB data}
read_csv(here::here("data/TB_notifications_2019-07-01.csv")) %>% 
  select(country, iso3, year, starts_with("new_sp_")) %>%
  head()
```





---
# TB notifications (gather)
  
create two new variables: variable `key` (contains all variable names starting with `new_sp_`) and variable `count` with the values:
  
```{r turn TB data into long form}
tb1 <- read_csv(here::here("data/TB_notifications_2019-07-01.csv")) %>% 
  select(country, iso3, year, starts_with("new_sp_")) %>%
  pivot_longer(starts_with("new_sp_"), "key", "count") 
tb1 %>% na.omit() %>% head()
```

---
# Separate columns
  
`separate (data, col, into, sep = "[^[:alnum:]]+", ...)`

`data %>% separate (col, into, sep = "[^[:alnum:]]+", ...)`



- split column `col` from data frame `frame` into a set of columns as specified in `into`
- `sep` is the splitting separator. By default splits happen for any non-alphanumeric value. <br>
Pro tip: specify `sep` to have some more control; any regular expression will work
- `unite` combines multiple variables into one

---
# TB notification (separate)
  
Work on `key`: 
  
```{r extract variable names from original column names}
tb2 <- tb1 %>% 
  separate(key, sep = "_", into=c("foo_new", "foo_sp", "sexage")) 
tb2 %>% na.omit() %>% head()
```


---
# TB notification (separate again)
  
Now split `sexage` into first character (m/f) and rest.
`substr` allows to extract sub strings from a character vector (see `?substr`):
  
```{r continue extracting variable names}
tb3 <- tb2 %>% select(-starts_with("foo")) %>%
  mutate(sex=substr(sexage, 1, 1), 
         age=substr(sexage, 2, length(sexage))) %>%
  select(-sexage)
tb3 %>% na.omit() %>% head()
```

# Your turn

Read the genes data from folder `data`. Column names contain data and are kind of messy. 

```{r}
genes <- read_csv(here::here("data/genes.csv"))
```

Produce the data frame called `gtidy` as shown below:

```{r code solution to genes wrangling, echo=FALSE}
gtidy <- genes %>%
pivot_longer(-id, names_to="variable", values_to="expr") %>%
separate(variable, c("trt", "leftover"), "-") %>%
separate(leftover, c("time", "rep"), "\\.") %>%
mutate(trt = sub("W", "", trt)) %>%
mutate(rep = sub("R", "", rep))
```

```{r}
head(gtidy)
```


---
# Plot the genes data overlaid with group means

.pull-left[
```{r compute group means, fig.show='hide'}
gmean <- gtidy %>% 
  group_by(id, trt, time) %>% 
  summarise(expr = mean(expr))
gtidy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = trt, y = expr, colour=time)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(data = gmean, aes(group = time)) +
  facet_wrap(~id)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r plot the genes data overlais with group means, echo=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height = 5}
gtidy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = trt, y = expr, colour=time)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(data = gmean, aes(group = time)) +
  facet_wrap(~id)
```
]
