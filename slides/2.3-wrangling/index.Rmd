# Outline

- `broom`, `broom.mixed`: tidily extract elements from model summaries
- `dplyr`:  motivation, functions, chaining

# Models and model output

Functions such as `lm`, `glm`, `lmer`, ... allow us to fit models

e.g. fit french fry rating with respect to all designed main effects:

```{r models and model output}

ff_long <- french_fries %>% pivot_longer(potato:painty, names_to = "type", values_to = "rating")
ff_lm <- lm(rating~type+treatment+time+subject, 
data=ff_long)
```

---

`summary`, `str`, `resid`, `fitted`, `coef`, ... allow us to extract different parts of a model for a linear model. Other model functions work differently ... major headaches!

```{r examine the model fit}
summary(ff_lm)
```



---
# Tidying model output

The package `broom` gets model results into a tidy format at different levels

One value for each:

- model: `broom::glance`
- coefficient in the model: `broom::tidy`
- value in the dataset: `broom::augment`



---
# Goodness of fit statistics: `glance`

```{r goodness of fit statistics}
glance(ff_lm)
```

---
# Model estimates: `tidy`

```{r model estimates}
ff_lm_tidy <- tidy(ff_lm)
glimpse(ff_lm_tidy)
```

---
# Model diagnostics: `augment`

```{r model diagnostics}
ff_lm_all <- augment(ff_lm)
glimpse(ff_lm_all)
```

---
# Residual plot

```{r residual plot}
ggplot(ff_lm_all, aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid)) + geom_point()
```

---
# Adding random effects

Add random intercepts for each subject

```{r add random intercepts for each subject, results='hide'}
library(lme4)
fries_lmer <- lmer(rating~type+treatment+time+subject + ( 1 | subject ), 
data = ff_long)
```

# Your turn

The `broom.mixed` package provides similar functionality to mixed effects models as `broom` does for fixed effects models

- Try out the functionality of `broom.mixed` on each level: model, parameters, and data
- Augment the `ff_long` data with the model diagnostics
- Plot the residuals from the random effects model
- Plot fitted values against observed values

`r countdown::countdown(7)`

```{r solution to french fries modeling, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
## the model is pretty bad:
glance(fries_lmer)
tidy(fries_lmer)

ff_lmer_all <- augment(fries_lmer)

ggplot(ff_lmer_all, aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid)) + geom_point() +
  coord_equal()

ggplot(ff_lmer_all, aes(x=.fitted, y=rating)) + geom_point() +
  coord_equal() 
```

# dplyr verbs

There are five primary dplyr **verbs**, representing distinct data analysis tasks:

- `filter`: Remove the rows of a data frame, producing subsets
- `arrange`: Reorder the rows of a data frame
- `select`: Select particular columns of a data frame
- `mutate`: Add new columns that are functions of existing columns
- `summarise`: Create collapsed summaries of a data frame
- (`group_by`: Introduce structure to a data frame)
 
 
---
# Filter

select a subset of the observations (horizontal selection)
```{r select a subset of the observations}
load(here::here("data/french_fries.rda"))
french_fries %>%
    filter(subject == 3, time == 1)
```

---
# Arrange

order the observations (hierarchically)
```{r order the observations}
french_fries %>%
    arrange(desc(rancid)) %>%
    head
```

---
# Select

select a subset of the variables (vertical selection)
```{r select a subset of the variables}
french_fries %>%
    select(time, treatment, subject, rep, potato) %>%
    head
```

---
# Summarise

summarize observations into a (set of) one-number statistic(s):
```{r summarize observations into one-number statistic}
french_fries %>%
    summarise(mean_rancid = mean(rancid, na.rm=TRUE), 
              sd_rancid = sd(rancid, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---
# Summarise and group_by

```{r summarise and group_by}
french_fries %>%
    group_by(time, treatment) %>%
    summarise(mean_rancid = mean(rancid), sd_rancid = sd(rancid))
```

# Let's use these tools

to answer these french fry experiment questions:

- Is the design complete?
- Are replicates like each other? 
- How do the ratings on the different scales differ?
- Are raters giving different scores on average?
- Do ratings change over the weeks?

---
# Completeness 
If the data is complete it should be 12 x 10 x 3 x 2, that is, 6 records for each person. (Assuming that each person rated on all scales.) 

To check this we want to tabulate the number of records for each subject, time and treatment. This means select appropriate columns, tabulate, count and spread it out to give a nice table.

# Your turn

How many values do we have for each subject? Check the help for function `?n`

`r countdown::countdown(5)`
---
# French Fries - completeness

`n()`

```{r checking design completeness}
french_fries %>% 
  group_by(subject) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) 
```

---
# Other nice short cuts 

instead of `group_by(subject) %>% summarize(n = n())` we can use:

- `group_by(subject) %>% tally()`
- `count(subject)`

---
# Counts for subject by time

```{r counts for subject by time}
french_fries %>% 
  na.omit() %>%
  count(subject, time) %>%
  spread(time, n)
```


---
# How do scores change over time?

<br><br>

```{r do-scores-change-over-time, fig.show='hide'}
ggplot(data=ff_long, aes(x=time, y=rating, colour=treatment)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(subject~type) 
```

<br><br>

Plot on next slide...very messy!

```{r ref.label="do-scores-change-over-time", echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=9, out.width="80%"}

# Your Turn

Get summary of ratings over replicates and connect the dots for a picture as below:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=9, out.width="60%"}
ff_av <- ff_long %>% 
  group_by(subject, time, type, treatment) %>%
  summarise(rating=mean(rating))

ggplot(data=ff_long, aes(x=time, y=rating, colour=treatment)) + 
  facet_grid(subject~type) +
  geom_line(data=ff_av, aes(group=treatment))
```
