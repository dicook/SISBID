# Talking to people in  the class

We will be using breakout rooms throughout the class

4-6 people in each room

at the end of the time you will be 'zoomed back' into the main session


... in cases you get disconnected, just log back into the Zoom session and we get you back to your group.

<br><br><br><br><br>
Let's try this!

Introduce yourself to the people around you. Find out a little about them: where they come from, why they chose to do the workshop, what sort of data they usually work with, whether they have used R before, and a fun fact!

# Refresher

The three main locations that we will draw packages from are CRAN, Bioconductor and github.

From CRAN

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggenealogy")
```


From bioconductor

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("bigPint")
```

From github repos

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("heike/vinference")
```

---
# List of packages
