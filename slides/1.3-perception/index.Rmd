On the next slide we have made **two different plots** of 2012 TB incidence in the USA, based on two variables:

```{r}
tb_us |> filter(year == 2012) |> dplyr::select(sex, age, count)
```

- In arrangement A, separate plots are made for age, and sex is mapped to the x axis. 
- Conversely, in arrangement B, separate plots are made for sex, and age is mapped to the x axis. 

If you were to answer the question:  .orange[At which age(s) are the counts for males and females relatively the same?] Which plot makes this easier?

We've got two different rearrangements of the same information. .orange[At which age(s) are the counts for males and females relatively the same?] Which plot makes this easier?

What do we learn? That is different from each? What's the focus of each? What's easy, what's harder?

???
- Arrangement A makes it easier to directly compare male and female counts, separately for each age group. Generally, male counts are higher than female counts. There is a big difference between counts in the 45-54 age group, and over 65 counts are almost the same.
- Arrangement B makes it easier to directly compare counts by age group, separately for females and males. For females, incidence drops in the middle years. For males, it is pretty consistently high across age groups.

On the next slide we have made **two different plots** of TB incidence in the USA, based on three variables:

```{r}
tb_us |> select(year, sex, age, count) |> head(10)
```

- In plot type A, a line plot of counts is drawn separately by age and sex, and year is mapped to the x axis. 
- Conversely, in plot type B, counts for sex, and age are stacked into a bar chart, separately by age and sex, and year is mapped to the x axis

If you were to answer the question:  .orange[Is the trend for females generally decreasing over time?] Which plot makes this easier? 

```{r eval=FALSE}
- Plot type A makes it easier to examine trend for each group. This plot should probably have used 0 as the lower limit.
- Plot type  B is really only allowing the overall trend in count to be examined separately by age. It is also possible to see trend for males. Trend for females is buried because the bars start at irregular heights. The separated bars distract from digesting the overall count. 
```

Plot A computes the proportion and displays this as a line plot. Plot B uses a 100% chart of stacked bars for females and males. .orange[Is there an age effect in the proportion of incidence by gender? Is there also a temporal trend in the proportions?]

```{r}
countdown::countdown(1, 5, top=100, right=0)
```

```{r use a line plot for proportions, fig.height=3}
tb_us |> group_by(year, age) |>

  scale_fill_manual("Sex", values = c("#DC3220", "#005AB5")) + ylab("proportion") +
  ggtitle("Type B") + theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
- Plot A makes it easier to examine the trend in proportion. It is easy to miss that all the proportions are greater than 0.5, despite having a guideline (white) at 0.5. It could be argued that setting the vertical axis limits could alleviate this.  The fluctuations from year to year are more visible. Maybe adding a trend model could be helpful, to reduce this noise. Without colour its less visually appealing.
- Plot B makes it easier to see that the proportion for males is almost always higher than for females. It also suggests that there is little temporal trend, because the small fluctuations between years is less visible. Having colour makes it more visually appealing. There s less data processing.

# Perceptual principles

- Hierarchy of mappings
- Pre-attentive: some elements are noticed before you even realise it.
- Color palettes: qualitative, sequential, diverging.
- Proximity: Place elements for primary comparison close together. 
- Change blindness: When focus is interrupted differences may not be noticed.

# Sequential

dsamp <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000), ]
(d <- ggplot(dsamp, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = clarity)))
```

Map quantitative variable into color scheme that emphasizes one ened, either high or low. Rainbow scheme with viridis palette gives true grey scale. 

---
# Sequential

```{r mapping numbers to sequential scale, echo=TRUE, fig.width=7, fig.height=4, out.width="60%"}
d + scale_colour_brewer()
```

Default brewer sequential scale, blues. Focus is on the dark blue.

---
# Diverging

```{r mapping numbers to diverging scale, echo=TRUE, fig.width=7, fig.height=4, out.width="60%"}
d + scale_colour_brewer(palette="PRGn")
```

Map quantitative variable into color scheme that emphasizes both ends, either high AND low, de-emphasizing middle.

---
# Qualitative

```{r mapping numbers to qualitative palette, echo=TRUE, , fig.width=7, fig.height=4, out.width="60%"}
d + scale_colour_brewer(palette="Set1")
```

Map quantitative variable into color scheme to most differentiated set. It's possible to have too many colours to perceive the differences.

# Color blind-proofing

Online checking tool [coblis](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) allows you to upload an image and it will re-map the colors for different colour perception issues. The package `colorblind` has color blind friendly palettes (Susan VanderPlas: but the colours are awful, to my eye).

# Proximity

  geom_line() + geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~age, ncol=6) +

  scale_color_manual("Sex", values = c("#DC3220", "#005AB5"))  +
  ggtitle("Arrangement A")
```

```{r a line plot on age, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}

# Core principles

- Make a plot of your **data**! The hierarchy matters primarily if the structure is weak, or if differences between groups is small. 
- Knowing how to use proximity is an extremely valuable skill, and not well utilised.
- Use of colour is a very valuable skill, and there are many bad habits to over-use, too many colours or precariously mapping to a continuous variable to add another dimension. 

<br> 

- Show the data! There are a lot of examples where the statistics are plotted, but the magic comes when you plot the data. Plot the statistics if the volume of data is overwhelming, to tighten the message, but still plot the data for yourself and to keep track of the variability.
- One plot is never enough! Plot the data in different ways, it will help digest the relationships between variables, to gain a better understanding of the data.

# Your turn

This builds on the exercise from the previous session.

- Using your choice of country, for example, Australia, make a set of plots to explore the TB incidence among males relative to females over different age groups for 2012.
- Choose your best plot to answer this question: .orange[Is there a higher prevalence of TB among younger women in 2012?]
