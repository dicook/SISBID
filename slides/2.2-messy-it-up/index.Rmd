# Your turn

Warmup: 

Turn the `french_fries` data from wide format into a long format with variables `type` and `rating`. 
  
```{r your turn to work on the french fries data, echo=FALSE}
head(french_fries)
```

<h1>What would we like to find out about the french fries data set?</h1>

Go to menti.com at 7692 1506 and let us know!

# What would we like to know?
  
- Is the design complete?
- Are replicates like each other?
- How do the ratings on the different scales differ?
- Are raters giving different scores on average?
- Do ratings change over the weeks?
  
Each of these questions involves different summaries of the data.

# Gathering the french fries
  
```{r put french fries in long form}
ff_long <- french_fries %>% 
  pivot_longer(potato:painty, names_to = "type", values_to = "rating")
head(ff_long)
```


---
# Long to wide
  
In certain applications, we may wish to take a long dataset and convert it to a wide dataset (perhaps displaying in a table).

This is called "spreading" the data.

Examples: 

- Are replicates like each other? - we want to compare rep 1 values to rep 2 values
- How do the ratings on the different scales differ? - we want to compare ratings across different scales
- Are raters giving different scores on average? - we want to compare ratings across different raters
- Do ratings change over the weeks? - we want to compare ratings across different weeks




---
# Spread
  
We use the **pivot_wider** function from `tidyr` to do introduce variables with comparable values:
  
```{r spread it back into wide form}
head(ff_long, 3)

french_fries_weeks <- ff_long %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "time", values_from = "rating")

head(french_fries_weeks)
```

---
# Spread

```{r spread}
head(french_fries_weeks)
```

`pivot_wider` introduces one new variable for each level of the variable in `names_from`

and fills values in from the variable in `values_from`

# Comparing ratings from different weeks

Plot Week 1 against Week 9 in a scatterplot:


```{r week 1 vs week 9, fig.width=5, fig.height = 5}
french_fries_weeks %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `1`, y = `9`)) + geom_point()
```

Note the use of the backtick for variable names with special characters or numbers

# Your turn: Do the replicates look like each other?

Tackle this by plotting the replicates against each other using a scatterplot. 

You will need to first gather the data into long form, and then get the replicates spread into separate columns by replicate. 

`r countdown::countdown(5)`

```{r solution to do the replicates look like each other, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ff.s <- ff_long %>% pivot_wider(names_from=rep, values_from=rating)
ggplot(data=ff.s, aes(x=`1`, y=`2`)) + geom_point() +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1) 
ggplot(data=ff.s, aes(x=`1`, y=`2`)) + geom_point() +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1) + 
  xlab("Rep 1") + ylab("Rep 2") + facet_wrap(~type, ncol=5)
```

---
# Are ratings similar on different scales?
  
- Are ratings similar on the different scales: potato'y, buttery, grassy, rancid and painty?
- We need to gather the data into long form, and make plots facetted by the scale. 

--

```{r ratings on the different scales}
ff.m <- french_fries %>% 
pivot_longer(-(time:rep), names_to="type", values_to="rating")
head(ff.m)
```

---

```{r ratings on the different scales too}
ff.m <- french_fries %>% 
pivot_longer(-(time:rep), names_to="type", values_to="rating")
head(ff.m)
```

```{r, fig.height=2, fig.width=8}
ggplot(data=ff.m, aes(x=rating)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=2) + 
facet_wrap(~type, ncol=5) 
```

---
# Side-by-side boxplots

```{r side-by-Side boxplots, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
ggplot(data=ff.m, aes(x=type, y=rating, fill=type)) + 
geom_boxplot()
```

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn: What is the correlation between scales?

Tackle this problem by creating a wide form of the data by type of scale. 

`cor` allows you to create a correlation matrix. Look into the help `?cor` to get rid of `NA` values in the result. 

Draw a scatterplot of two scales with the highest (positive or negative) correlation value.

`r countdown::countdown(7)`

```{r solution to whether scales look like each other, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ff.scales <- ff_long %>% pivot_wider(names_from=type, values_from=rating)

cor(ff.scales[,5:9], use="pairwise.complete")

ggplot(data=ff.scales, aes(x=potato, y=buttery)) + geom_point() +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1) 
```

# Ratings by week

How do ratings change over the weeks?
Again, we use the long form of the data and plot:

```{r ratings by week, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
ff.m$time <- as.numeric(ff.m$time)
ggplot(data=ff.m, aes(x=time, y=rating, colour=type)) + 
geom_point(size=.75) +
geom_smooth() +
facet_wrap(~type)
```

# Your turn: Modelling ratings over time & different scales?

Find a linear model describing the average rating depending on the week (time) and type of scale as shown below.

Which form of the dataset should we use?

Challenge: can you plot the fitted lines from the model?

```{r ratings by week again, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
ff.m$time <- as.numeric(ff.m$time)
ggplot(data=ff.m, aes(x=time, y=rating, colour=type)) + 
geom_point(size=.75) +
geom_smooth() +
facet_wrap(~type)
```

`r countdown::countdown(7)`

```{r solution to model, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# long model is fine to use for a single model:

model <- lm(rating ~ type*time-1, data = ff_long)

ggplot(data=ff.m, aes(x=time, y=rating, colour=type)) + 
geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE, aes(colour = type))
```
