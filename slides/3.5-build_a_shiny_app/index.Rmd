# Your turn

- Join forces with your neighbours or work alone
- You need to make your own app, or interactive document, on a topic of your choice
- Some ideas are data from [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) or [fivethirtyeight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data)
- Your app needs to have 
    - at least one interactive plot
    - some GUI element like a menu or checkboxes
    - some nice styling

`r emo::ji("scream")` If this is too scary, work through the steps in the next few slides instead, to make an app.

# RStudio Connect and ShinyApps

- Sign up for an account on https://www.shinyapps.io/<br/><br/>
- Authenticate your account<br/><br/>
- Install the library rsconnect (this is the part that may require admin access to your machine)<br/><br/>
- Follow the instructions on ShinyApps.io to authenticate and upload your first app!

---
# Initiate

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` Using the RStudio `File` menu, 

- choose `New file`, 
- choose "Shiny web app"
- Give it a name, and choose `Single file`

This will create a folder in your workspace with the same name as you gave your app. It will also open the `app.R` file in your text editor pane. 

`r emo::ji("stop_sign")` Click the `Run App` button on the RStudio window. 

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` Click `Publish` to upload your app to the shinyapps.io server. 

`r emo::ji("congratulations")` You've just published your first app

---
# Make it yours

Change the plot to use `ggplot`, this involves changing the server function to be this:

```{r eval = F}
server <- function(input, output) {

    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
        ggplot(faithful, aes(x=waiting)) + geom_histogram(bins = input$bins)
    })
}
```

You will also need to add `library(ggplot2)` at the top of the file, just after `library(shiny)`.

`r emo::ji("stop_sign")` Click the `Run App` button on the RStudio window. (Fix any errors) 

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` Click `Publish` to re-upload your app to the shinyapps.io server. 

`r emo::ji("congratulations")` You've just published your first modifed app

---
# Make the plot interactive

Change from a static ggplot plot, to an interactive plotly plot, by 

1. changing the server function to look like this. Note `renderPlotly`

```{r eval = F}
server <- function(input, output) {

    output$distPlot <- renderPlotly({
        p <- ggplot(faithful, aes(x=waiting)) +
            geom_histogram(bins = input$bins)
        print(ggplotly(p))
    })
}
```

2. Changing the `ui` function to render plotly output

```{r eval = F}
mainPanel(
  plotlyOutput("distPlot")
)
```

3. Adding `library(plotly)` to the top of the file.

`r emo::ji("stop_sign")` Click the `Run App` button on the RStudio window. (Fix any errors) 

---
# Change the UI

Convert the slide into a numeric input, by changing the `ui` function to be:

```{r eval = F}
sidebarLayout(
  sidebarPanel(
    numericInput("bins", "nbins", 30)
  ),
```

(The `numericInput` replaces the `sliderInput` code)

`r emo::ji("stop_sign")` Click the `Run App` button on the RStudio window. (Fix any errors) 

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` Click `Publish` to re-upload your app to the shinyapps.io server. 

`r emo::ji("congratulations")` You've just published your second modifed app
